This is the final project for the class CSC 591 021 taught by Professor Menzies at NC State University for spring 2024.



**Project Overview:**
In this project, we worked on making Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression models better by adjusting two important settings: the penalty parameter (C) and the slack variable (Ïµ). We used three different methods:

1. Grid Search: A basic method where we tried out many combinations of settings to find the best ones.

2. Optuna: A more advanced method that changes the range of settings to test based on what has worked best so far, aiming to find the best settings faster and more efficiently.

2. Sequential Model Optimization (SMO): A smart method that uses less data to quickly focus on the most promising settings, saving time and effort.

**Goals:**
To see which method is best at finding the right settings for the SVM models.
To find out which method gets the best results without using too much computational time and power.
