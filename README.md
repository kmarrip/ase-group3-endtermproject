This is the final project for the class CSC 591 021 taught by projessor Menzies at NC state University for spring 2024.
This class primarily deals with SMO sequential model optimization and RRP Random recursive projections.

What we have comeup with so far is get the health training data set and have base classifier for reference.
Then apply these two algorithms

1. SMO on SMO
2. SMO on RRP
3. RRP on SMO
4. RRP on RRP

Create a profiler instance (this can be done using the decorator pattern in python).
Compare the four techniques against the base-line model
